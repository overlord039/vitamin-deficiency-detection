The **Vitamin Deficiency Detection** project aims to develop an AI-based solution that diagnoses possible vitamin deficiencies by analyzing images of the user's eyes, lips, tongue, and nails. It utilizes image processing techniques and a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect early signs of vitamin insufficiency. The application helps users avoid invasive blood tests and provides early insights into deficiencies to prevent serious health conditions.

### Key Features:
1. **Image-Based Analysis:** The system analyzes images of key body parts (eyes, lips, tongue, nails) to detect deficiency symptoms.
2. **Deep Learning Model:** Uses CNN models like ResNet or VGGNet, with transfer learning and custom ensemble techniques to improve accuracy.
3. **Prediction and Recommendations:** After diagnosis, it suggests appropriate dietary changes to address the detected deficiencies.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is designed to be accessible and easy to use, ensuring users can quickly upload images and receive reports.

### Technical Workflow:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and converted to a tensor format suitable for deep learning models.
- **Model Training:** The CNN model is trained on a dataset that differentiates between healthy and vitamin-deficient individuals.
- **Deficiency Classification:** The model predicts specific vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin A, B, C, D, and E based on learned patterns from the images.
- **Results:** Users receive a report of potential deficiencies along with recommended food items to help mitigate the problem.

This tool could play a crucial role in early detection of vitamin deficiencies, promoting better health outcomes.
